Gajim is a modern XMPP client written in Python with GTK4. It's the most popular XMPP client on PC due to its easy-to-use design and full-rounded feature set. Gajim abstracts many of the murky attributes of XMPP in order to have an easy-to-use experience with good user interface as well as good user experience.

## Installing Gajim
Gajim supports GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows.
### Linux
The developers of Gajim heavily recommend installing the Flatpak of Gajim due to it being a GTK4 app. You will likely have a significantly better experience if you do so rather than using your system's native package manager.
