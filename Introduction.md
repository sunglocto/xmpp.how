# Introduction to XMPP

XMPP (historically known as Jabber) is an open standard that allows you to communicate in a private and independent way. Like email, you can use any XMPP-enabled client to chat with any user on any XMPP server!

## Why XMPP?
There are many reasons why XMPP may be right for you.
- *Decentralized*: The XMPP network is not owned by a single corporation, it consists of many interconnected servers ran by people and organizations all over the world. No one person or organisation has control over all of your communications.
- *Freedom*: The XMPP standard is flexible, allowing you to use it in the way you want.
- *Mature*: XMPP has been used and updated for 25 years, it is battle-tested and well-designed, and has been used in multiple battle-tested technologies outside of the ecosystem.
- *Independence*: If you're so inclined, you can run your very own XMPP server and participate in the network. It is fairly cheap to do so. (Of course, you could always use someone else's server.)
- *Secure*: You can keep your conversations secure using end to end encryption technologies such as OMEMO.
- *Private*: You don't need a phone number or email address to use XMPP, and XMPP software doesn't spy on you.
- *Open Source*: The XMPP standard is free for anyone to implement and use, and most XMPP clients and servers are Free and Open Source Software.

## Why not XMPP?
As of writing, XMPP and its ecosystem of clients and servers is overall well developed, but there are some aspects that are still a work in progress. You should not use XMPP if you *need* one or more of the following features:
- *Voice/Video*: One-on-one voice and video calls are available for all mobile clients, but not yet for PC clients. Group voice/video calls are not yet widely supported, but are available for a couple of clients.
- *Large Communities*: XMPP works well for direct messaging and small interpersonal groups (<100 people), but does not work well for massive groups that need advanced permission controls and many different channels. You should think of XMPP as more of a WhatsApp or Facebook replacement, rather than a Discord or Slack replacement.
- *1:1 Discord (or some other proprietary service) Replacement*: Certain clients can look a lot like Discord, but no client or server looks and behaves _exactly_ like Discord. You can alleviate a ton of frustration by just remembering that XMPP isn't Discord/whatever else you've used, and does things differently, especially in terms of UI. (though, there's only so much difference you can have IM wise.
- *Perfect Software*: XMPP software is sometimes slightly janky, we're all doing our best.

## Getting Started
To get started, you must first get a [Client](/clients) for your device.
