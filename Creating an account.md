The process of creating an account on a particular server wildly varies and we cannot document every possible way of making an account. However, the process is essentially identical across three categories:
- Registration in a client
- Automatic online registration
- Manual online registration
- Invite-only
We will show a server that falls in each registration category to visualize the process, however it's important to note that we *do not endorse nor recommend any particular servers shown in this document.

We will be using Psi+ to show the process of making an account inside a client.
### Registration in a client
(Don't have a client? Go to [Clients](Clients.md))
When a client asks you to add an account, it's possible to send a registration request to the target server:

Enter the server's domain that you want to register with (in this case, 07f.de), then click on the button to continue.
The server will most likely prompt you to enter a username and password, and then ask you to solve a CAPTCHA. This is done in order to prevent spam from automated accounts:

Afterwards, you will have an account that you can log into and start chatting with!
### Automatic online registration
Some instances do not want people to register using a client, and instead wish for them to register using their own online portals. We cannot make a tutorial for every single instance that does this because each approach will be different, but a typical registration form looks like this:

You enter a username, password, and in some cases an email or phone number. An instance that uses this method will almost certainly require you to also perform a CAPTCHA challenge.

This may automatically create your account, or the request may be verified by an administrator of the server.
### Manual online registration
As stated previously the steps for this will wildly vary. But as a baseline, you will contact an instance administrator and they will create an account for you manually.

### Invite-only
As the name suggests, servers that are invite-only cannot be registered on at all unless you somehow get an invite to the server. This is usually used in tight-knit communities that do not wish to get trouble from unknown participants.

### "These all suck! What should I do?"
If you are dissatisfied with the account creation experience on public servers, then you should make your own server, or if you have a friend that uses XMPP, you can ask them for an account.

Now that you've registered for an account, and once you've logged in to a client with your relevant authentication, [it's time to use XMPP!](/How%20To%20Use%20XMPP)
